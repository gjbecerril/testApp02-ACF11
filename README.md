# testApp02-ACF11
This is an ACF version of the testApp02 (Lucee) repo. The Lucee version can be accessed here: https://github.com/gjbecerril/testApp02

In order to run this code, place all files of this repository in the same directory. The “index.cfm” file contains links to all three challenge files. The following are URL examples on how to run the files locally. The files can be placed in subfolders. It is important to mention that this code was tested on ACF 11 only since, at the moment, I only have access to a PROD server running this version besides Lucee.
